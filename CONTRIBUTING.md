# Contributing to Caliper UI

Thanks for your interest. This covers the development setup, how the project is
laid out, and how it is tested and released.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook     # component docs + a11y panel at http://localhost:6006
npm run dev           # the demo page at http://localhost:5173
```

Each component lives in its own folder under `src/components/` with the
component, its `.scss`, a typed `index.ts`, a Storybook story (with `play`
interaction tests), and a usage doc via autodocs.

## Design tokens

The tokens are the single source of truth and are authored as W3C DTCG JSON under
`tokens/`. Everything else - the published `tokens.css`, the SCSS maps the
components compile against, and the Figma exports - is generated from there.

```bash
npm run build:tokens   # regenerate tokens/tokens.css + src/tokens/_generated.scss
npm run build:figma    # regenerate the Figma exports under tokens/figma/
npm run tokens:check   # rebuild and fail if any generated output has drifted
```

Do not edit the generated files (`tokens/tokens.css`, `src/tokens/_generated.scss`,
`tokens/figma/*.json`) by hand - change `tokens/*.json` and rebuild. CI runs
`tokens:check` and fails on drift. `src/tokens/_breakpoints.scss` is the one
hand-authored map: breakpoints are consumed only in Sass (a media query can't
read a custom property) and are not part of the DTCG/CSS/Figma pipeline.

## Testing

Two layers, both running the real components in a real browser.

**Interaction tests** live in the stories as `play` functions and run headless
through the Storybook Vitest addon (`npm test`). They drive the behavior that is
hard to eyeball: arrow-key navigation in Tabs, type-ahead and selection in
Select, the Modal focus trap and focus restore, the Tooltip showing on focus and
dismissing on Escape. The same steps replay visibly in Storybook's Interactions
panel.

**Visual regression** lives in `tests/visual.spec.ts` and runs with Playwright
(`npm run test:visual`). It snapshots one representative story per component in
both themes, so a styling change that shifts a pixel is caught on review.
Baselines are committed under `tests/__screenshots__/` and carry the OS in the
file name, so a run on a different platform regenerates rather than fails
falsely. Update them on purpose with `npm run test:visual:update`; in CI they run
in the pinned Playwright container so screenshots compare against matching
baselines (a Linux set is committed for that image).

**Contrast** is checked by `npm run test:contrast`, which verifies every
color-role pairing meets WCAG 2.2 AA.

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all of this on every push and pull
request: lint, format, types, the token drift check, and the build in one job;
the interaction tests and visual regression in the pinned Playwright container.

## Releases and deployment

Releases go out via [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and
npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC, with provenance) - no stored npm token. Add a
changeset with `npm run changeset` in any PR that should ship; merging the
resulting Version PR publishes.

The demo and docs ship from a single Vercel project: every push to `main` deploys
production and every pull request gets a preview URL. One `vercel-build` produces
both - the demo at the root and Storybook at `/storybook`.
